      description: 'On a shabby wooden shelf bolted to the brick wall, a number of old jars and bottles were found, forgotten by their owner. Every bottle had a story to tell, every one was unique. In trying to replicate the bottles in their entireity, I failed. The castings broke, only the intrinsic details and patina would remain.',

      intro: 'In the plans and section, we will notice two volumes and a third grid-like element. These should be read as tools, with a function.',
      description: 'The first, most public, element is the U-shaped vertical grid. Attached are several panels depicting the work <em>Genital Wallpaper</em>. This provocating work is both the signboard and the thorn of the public square; it implores the pedestrian\'s attention (the thorn) but at the same time it offers its soft shadow.<br>In that shadow arises the second element of our apparatus: a rusty box, one person high. Soon we notice one side is missing, leading us in and down into the depth of the street. This second element is a coupler between street and, at the end of stairs, a prefabricated concrete basement. It is the third and last of the tools.<br>Bold in its boringness it holds our second work of art: <em>Abstraktes Bild (Courbet)</em>. Holding art is but a fraction of this element\'s function. At the same time it holds, through its uneasy relation to the rusty box through wich we plunged down, a sectret. That secret is uncovered on the moment we have left <em>Abstraktes Bild</em> behind: <em>Barre de Bois rond</em>. Obscure in its message, clearly kept at a distance, obscure behind the steel steps, clearly a secret.<br>We went from signboard over exploration to secret. These are the stadia where both the most striking and most fragile works of art can be installed. These are the ways to wield this tool.',

      description: '"Tell me what you see." It\'s Maaike\'s voice, barely audible through the music. Psychedelic vibes repeat themself and I repeat them in my head and the curtains reapeats by waving and the floor repeats by shaking and the smokefilled room vibrates. I let my eyes wander, observing my surroundings. The high armchair blocks my sight left and right. Right before me is a glass hourglass-shaped object. Above it, a spotlight. One of those industrial things we use in theaters. It\'s the only visible source of light, and its shadows are hard and fragmented. Lightly swaying on a thin steel cable, anchored in the ceiling. A painted ceiling leads the way for my eyes to the single visible wall. High vertical schelves display translucent fluids. Slowly the black curtain that shut us off from the outer world turns smokey gray. William, our sound technician, lits a second cigar. Maaike is talking to him but I can\'t understand. The unusual object, shaped like an hourglass, seems to fill the room with psychedelic tones. From the ground up, everything trembles, shakes, vibrates on the music. I am told the sound system is integrated in the void under our feet. Along with the anti-rhythm I plunge backwards into the soft black leather that holds the body I left behind.',
